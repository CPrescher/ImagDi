# ImagDi

An angular/electron app for fast browsing and displaying of images. 
When using as an electron app it works for local images, as a server frontend it can access files on a server as well as with [extra-data](https://extra-data.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which is the data access library for the European XFEL, Hamburg.

This is app is currently under development and rather a playground than a functional program.
